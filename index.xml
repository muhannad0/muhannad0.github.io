Links will be provided to the other guides I used for reference as we go along the process.
The choice for Hugo as a static site generator is mainly because:
It is very quick to build. The ability to use markdown syntax to create your pages is nice.</description></item><item><title>Hello World!</title><link>https://muhannad0.github.io/posts/hello-world-2020-04-20/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Apr 2020 23:35:40 +0500</pubDate><guid>https://muhannad0.github.io/posts/hello-world-2020-04-20/</guid><description>Who? Hi there! I&amp;rsquo;m a systems engineer from the Maldives. Majority of my work is on design and implementing IT infrastructure and managing Ops of a small IT team. But lately I&amp;rsquo;ve been really automation, config management, cloud services and little bit of development.
You can find more details on what I do at LinkedIn or say hello on Twitter
Why? A bit of a background story. I always tend to research a lot and see what others are doing before I try to implement something; whether its a new technology, new practice etc.</description></item></channel></rss>
