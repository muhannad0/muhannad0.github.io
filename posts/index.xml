      <description>Who? Hi there! I&amp;rsquo;m a systems engineer from the Maldives. Majority of my work is on design and implementing IT infrastructure and managing Ops of a small IT team. But lately I&amp;rsquo;ve been really automation, config management, cloud services and little bit of development.
You can find more details on what I do at LinkedIn or say hello on Twitter
Why? A bit of a background story. I always tend to research a lot and see what others are doing before I try to implement something; whether its a new technology, new practice etc.</description>
