In this post Iâ€™ll be sharing my experience attempting the <a href=https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/>Cloud Resume Challenge</a>.</p><p><strong>Tasks:</strong> 16 âœ…</p><p>With the world temporarily shutting down due to the pandemic, things were very slow moving at work. I found myself with more time apart from work tasks, decided to make use of it and learn something new. Iâ€™ve always wanted to gain more knowledge on cloud based technologies and surprisingly saw the <a href="https://twitter.com/forrestbrazeal/status/1254822417203113986?s=20">Twitter post</a> by <a href=https://forrestbrazeal.com/>Forrest Brazeal</a>, about this challenge and had a look at it. I made up my mind to take it on and started working on it in May.</p><p>After a month and half of long hours of researching, watching videos and coding I can proudly say Iâ€™ve been able to tick off all the tasks on the challenge!</p><p>This challenge requires us to make a simple resume website (front end) and develop a small visit counter feature (back end) using specific resources on AWS. Along with that we have to make use of infrastructure-as-code to deploy the necessary resources automatically on AWS and use CI/CD workflows on Github so that any updates to our source code (either front end or back end) are automatically pushed to AWS.</p><p>Have a look at my resume website running on AWS: <a href=https://muhannad.io>muhannad.io</a></p><p>I decided to approach the challenge in phases with similar tasks together.</p><h2 id=phase-1-build-a-resume-website-using-html-and-css>Phase 1: Build a resume website using HTML and CSS</h2><p><strong>Tasks:</strong> 2 âœ… 3 âœ…</p><p>Web design isnâ€™t really my strong suite, but Iâ€™m satisfied with what I could build from scratch. (Maybe a bit Web 1.0? ðŸ˜…)
<img src=/images/post-images/resume-webpage-final.png alt="CSS Layout"></p><h2 id=phase-2-host-the-website-on-aws-s3-and-enable-https-using-cloudfront>Phase 2: Host the website on AWS S3 and enable HTTPS using CloudFront</h2><p><strong>Tasks:</strong> 4 âœ… 5 âœ… 6 âœ…</p><p>Following the <a href=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/hosting-websites-on-s3-examples.html>AWS documentation</a>, it was pretty straightforward. AWS S3 enables static website hosting and using SSL certificates generated by Certificate Manager we can include them in CloudFront distribution to enable secure access to the website. After updating the DNS entries for the domain to point to the CloudFront distribution, the <a href=https://muhannad.io>resume website</a> was live.</p><h2 id=phase-3-build-a-site-visit-counter-using-aws-api-gateway-lambda-functions-dynamodb>Phase 3: Build a site visit counter using AWS API Gateway, Lambda Functions, DynamoDB</h2><p><strong>Tasks:</strong> 7 âœ… 8 âœ… 9 âœ… 10 âœ… 11 âœ…</p><p>Honestly, this phase was <strong>the hardest</strong> part for me. I can only rate myself a beginner in software development (apart from writing simple scripts), but Iâ€™m really glad that I was able to complete it.</p><p>I learned how storing data on DynamoDB works and wrote the back end Lambda function using Python and a simple Javascript for the front end. To tie both together, I was able to expose the necessary endpoints for the front end Javascript using API Gateway, which triggers the Lambda function to update the counter value stored in DynamoDB.
<img src=/images/post-images/srvls_ddb_items.png alt="DynamoDB Table Items"></p><p>This is the diagram I used to figure out how I could write specific functions for each operation.
<img src=/images/post-images/srvls_crc_visit_backend.png alt="Application Sketch Diagram"></p><p>It was a huge learning curve, but I think this concept of serverless applications brings a lot of value. You donâ€™t have to worry about the underlying resources and can focus on developing the application.</p><h2 id=phase-4-deploying-the-aws-components-using-infra-as-code>Phase 4: Deploying the AWS components using Infra-as-Code</h2><p><strong>Tasks:</strong> 12 âœ…</p><p>It is always good to automate what youâ€™re doing manually. For example, rather than creating all the resources on AWS web console, we can define them in a configuration file and run a few commands to update the whole stack.
<img src=/images/post-images/iac_sls_deploy.png alt="Deploy Servless Stack"></p><p>I used the <a href=https://www.serverless.com/>Serverless Framework</a> for the back end and a <a href=https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/>CloudFormation</a> template for the front end resources.
<img src=/images/post-images/iac_cfn_stacks.png alt="cfn stacks"></p><h2 id=phase-5-enabling-cicd-workflows-on-github>Phase 5: Enabling CI/CD workflows on Github</h2><p><strong>Tasks:</strong> 14 âœ… 15 âœ…</p><p>After checking the both components into Github repositories, I used Github actions to enable automated workflows to test the back end code and deploy it to AWS when thereâ€™s a commit to the main branch.
<img src=/images/post-images/cicd_backend_run.png alt="cicd backend"></p><p>Similarly any updates to the front end are also triggered whenever thereâ€™s a commit to the main branch and the updated files are synced to the S3 bucket.</p><h2 id=phase-6-get-aws-certified>Phase 6: Get AWS Certified</h2><p><strong>Tasks:</strong> 1 âœ…</p><p>I studied for about 2 weeks for the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam. The material is quite easy to follow and with enough practice on the AWS platform, it is easily doable.

Eventually you get to the a-ha moment and everything falls into place. Also, make sure to practice regularly.</p></li><li><p><strong>First cloud application!</strong> It has given me a clear idea on what components would be included in developing and supporting an application. Additionally, how time can be saved by using the right resources, automating some of the tedious tasks and keeping your focus on developing the application.</p></li><li><p><strong>First cloud certification!</strong> Even though it might be an introductory certificate, it gave me the confidence that I could attempt for the more advanced ones with enough experience.</p></li></ul><p>Iâ€™d like to thank Forrest for writing up this challenge. Each step is well linked to the other and teaches much about how to develop applications for the cloud. I recommend anyone whoâ€™s looking to learn more about developing applications on the cloud to try this out.</p><h2 id=future-plans>Future Plans</h2><p>Coming from an IT infrastructure background for the most part of my career, completing this challenge has been an eye-opener. I believe itâ€™s important to adapt to new concepts for working with the cloud and be ready for what the future might bring. I think this is a turning point for my career and will be working on finding a role more focused on cloud engineering.</p><p>Iâ€™ve already got a few ideas to improve on my coding skills. Next Iâ€™m going to try to build a serverless notification bot for Telegram. Stay tuned, as I&rsquo;ll be sharing my experience here.</p><p>It&rsquo;s always going to be continous learning from here on. I&rsquo;ll be exploring other areas in cloud and the tooling involved.</p><h2 id=more-details>More Details</h2><p>Feel free to reach out on <a href=https://twitter.com/monde_>Twitter</a> or <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/muhannad0/>LinkedIn</a> if you&rsquo;ve got any questions.</p><p>You can find out more on each phase, in detail, in the <a href=/post/the-cloud-resume-challenge/>first post</a> about the challenge.</p></div><div class=tags><div class=taxosfloating_left><p>Categories</p></div><div class=termsfloating_right><p><a href=/categories/blog/>blog</a>
